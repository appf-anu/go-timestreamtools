Tools for processing time series images.

Intended to be used in a chain as an image processing pipeline, see `run_pipeline.pbs` for example.

As of 2018-04-06 the helptext is out of date (mainly concerning behaviour when each tool is run without an output, and what happens with temporary directories)
